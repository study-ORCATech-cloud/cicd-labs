# Solutions for LAB05: Building Docker Images with Jenkins

This document provides the completed `Jenkinsfile` for LAB05. Students should refer to this after attempting to complete the `TODO` items in `Jenkins/LAB05-Docker-Image-Build/Jenkinsfile` themselves.

## ‚úÖ Completed `Jenkinsfile`

Below is a complete and working `Jenkinsfile` for this lab. The specific `IMAGE_NAME` and the choice of agent setup might vary based on the student's environment and whether they intend to push to Docker Hub.

```groovy
pipeline {
    // Solution for TODO_AGENT_SETUP:
    // Using a Docker agent is a robust choice. Assumes Docker Pipeline plugin is installed
    // and Docker socket is correctly mounted and accessible.
    agent {
        docker {
            image 'docker:24.0-git' // Includes Docker CLI and Git
            args '-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /tmp:/tmp'
            // Important: The user inside this container (often root by default in official Docker images)
            // or the Jenkins user if running with a specific user, needs permissions to access the mounted Docker socket.
            // If Jenkins is running as a 'jenkins' user on the host and that user was added to the 'docker' group on the host,
            // and Jenkins itself runs in Docker with the socket mounted, `agent any` might also work if the Jenkins
            // container itself has the `docker` CLI. The Docker agent is generally more explicit.
        }
    }

    environment {
        // Solution for TODO_IMAGE_NAME:
        // Replace 'your-dockerhub-username' with your actual Docker Hub username if pushing.
        // If not pushing, a simple name like 'lab05-flask-app' is fine.
        IMAGE_NAME = 'your-dockerhub-username/lab05-flask-app' // Or 'lab05-flask-app' for local only

## üìù Explanation of Solutions

1.  **`TODO_AGENT_SETUP`**: 
    *   The solution uses `agent { docker { ... } }` which is a clean way to ensure Docker CLI tools are available. It mounts the Docker socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) from the host, allowing the Docker commands inside this agent container to control the host's Docker daemon. This is a common pattern.
    *   **Important Note:** The user running Jenkins or the Docker daemon process within the agent container needs appropriate permissions for `/var/run/docker.sock` on the host machine.

2.  **`TODO_IMAGE_NAME`**: 
    *   `IMAGE_NAME = 'your-dockerhub-username/lab05-flask-app'`
    *   Students should replace `your-dockerhub-username` with their actual Docker Hub ID if they intend to push. Otherwise, a local name like `lab05-flask-app` is sufficient for building and local testing.

3.  **`TODO_IMAGE_TAG`**: 
    *   `IMAGE_TAG = "0.1.${env.BUILD_NUMBER}"`
    *   This creates a unique tag for each build (e.g., `0.1.1`, `0.1.2`), which is good practice for versioning.

4.  **`TODO_BUILD_IMAGE`**: 
    *   `docker.build("${IMAGE_NAME}:${IMAGE_TAG}", "--pull -f ${DOCKERFILE_PATH}/Dockerfile ${DOCKERFILE_PATH}")`
    *   This command builds the Docker image.
        *   `"${IMAGE_NAME}:${IMAGE_TAG}"`: Specifies the full name and tag for the new image.
        *   `"--pull ..."`: These are arguments passed to the `docker build` command.
            *   `--pull`: Ensures the base image (`python:3.9-slim`) is updated before building.
            *   `-f ${DOCKERFILE_PATH}/Dockerfile`: Specifies the path to the `Dockerfile`.
            *   `${DOCKERFILE_PATH}`: Specifies the build context (the `app` directory).

5.  **`TODO_RUN_IMAGE` (Optional)**:
    *   `sh 'docker run -d -p 5001:5000 --name lab05app --rm ${IMAGE_NAME}:${IMAGE_TAG}'`
        *   Runs the container in detached mode (`-d`), maps port 5000 in the container to 5001 on the host (`-p 5001:5000`), names it `lab05app`, and ensures it's removed on stop (`--rm`).
    *   The `script` block with `sleep`, `curl`, and `docker logs/stop` provides a basic test and cleanup for the running container.

6.  **`TODO_PUSH_IMAGE` (Optional/Advanced)**:
    *   The `when` condition `expression { env.IMAGE_NAME.contains('/') && env.DOCKER_CREDENTIAL_ID != null && env.DOCKER_CREDENTIAL_ID != '' }` is a safeguard to only attempt push if the image name looks like a Docker Hub repo and a credential ID is specified.
    *   `DOCKER_CREDENTIAL_ID = 'your-jenkins-docker-credential-id'`: Students **must** replace `your-jenkins-docker-credential-id` with the ID of a credential they've configured in Jenkins for Docker Hub.
    *   `docker.withRegistry('', DOCKER_CREDENTIAL_ID) { ... }`: This block tells Jenkins to use the specified credentials when interacting with Docker Hub (the `''` indicates the default Docker Hub registry).
    *   `docker.image("${IMAGE_NAME}:${IMAGE_TAG}").push()`: Pushes the tagged image.

7.  **`TODO_CLEANUP_RUNNING_CONTAINER` (Optional)**:
    *   `sh 'docker stop lab05app || true'` and `sh 'docker rm lab05app || true'` are added in the `post` block to ensure the test container (if run) is stopped and removed, even if earlier steps failed. The `|| true` prevents the pipeline from failing if the container doesn't exist.

This setup provides a solid foundation for building Docker images within a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline.
