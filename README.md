# CI/CD Automation Labs Repository

Welcome to the **CI/CD Automation Labs** — a practical, tool-focused repository designed to help you master continuous integration and deployment using **real-world DevOps workflows**. Whether you're working with GitHub Actions, Jenkins, ArgoCD, or Docker, this repo has you covered with **structured labs** per tool using production-ready configurations and copy-based learning methodology.

---

## 🧩 What's Inside?

Each CI/CD technology has its **own top-level folder**, containing multiple **in-depth labs**. Labs are self-contained, progressive, and built to reflect actual scenarios you'll encounter in professional pipelines. All configurations are complete and ready to copy and use.
