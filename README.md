# CI/CD Automation Labs

Welcome to the **CI/CD Automation Labs** repository — your hands-on guide to mastering **continuous integration** and **continuous deployment** using GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, and more.

This repo is designed for DevOps learners and practitioners who want to build, test, and deploy applications automatically and reliably.

## 🚀 What You'll Learn

By completing these labs, you'll gain practical experience in:
- Automating builds and tests using GitHub Actions
- Creating pipelines and build jobs in Jenkins
- Deploying applications with Docker Compose and Kubernetes
- Implementing GitOps using ArgoCD
- Managing CI/CD secrets and environment configs securely
