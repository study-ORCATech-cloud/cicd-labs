|-----|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 01  | GitHub Actions: Hello World          | Basic workflow, push trigger       |
| 02  | Python Test Workflow                 | Run `pytest`, linting, matrix CI   |
| 03  | Docker Build & Push                  | Build and publish Docker image     |
| 04  | Secrets & Environment Variables      | Secure workflows with secrets      |
