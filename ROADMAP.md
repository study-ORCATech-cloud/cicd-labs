## üß† Suggested Learning Flow

**Teaching Methodology**: All labs use a **copy-based learning approach** ‚Äî complete, production-ready configurations are provided for students to copy and deploy while following detailed step-by-step instructions. This methodology ensures immediate success and builds confidence through hands-on experience with enterprise-grade DevOps tools.

**Recommended Progression**:
- Start with **GitHub Actions** for basic CI concepts and cloud-native automation
- Advance to **Jenkins** for custom pipelines, agent control, and enterprise CI/CD
- Explore **Docker-CD** for containerized CD pipelines and microservices deployment
- Finish with **ArgoCD** to adopt a GitOps deployment model and Kubernetes-native CD

Each track builds foundational knowledge that enhances understanding of the subsequent technologies.
