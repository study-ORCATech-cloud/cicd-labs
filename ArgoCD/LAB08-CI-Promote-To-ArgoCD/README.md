# LAB08: CI/CD Integration with GitOps Promotion Workflows

Welcome to Lab 08! You've mastered multi-environment GitOps workflows with manual promotion from staging to production. Now it's time to **automate the entire CI/CD pipeline** by integrating continuous integration with your GitOps promotion workflows.

In modern DevOps practices, you want to automate not just the deployment (which ArgoCD handles), but also the promotion process itself. This lab will teach you how to build end-to-end CI/CD pipelines that automatically build, test, and promote applications through your environments using GitOps principles.

For detailed step-by-step instructions to complete this lab, please refer to **[./LAB.md](./LAB.md)**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
- Design and implement complete CI/CD pipelines that integrate with GitOps workflows
- Automate application builds, testing, and image creation using GitHub Actions
- Implement automated promotion workflows that update GitOps repositories
- Configure CI pipelines to automatically promote changes from staging to production
- Handle image versioning, tagging, and manifest updates in GitOps repositories
- Set up proper CI triggers, approval gates, and rollback mechanisms
- Integrate container registries with CI/CD and ArgoCD workflows
- Implement security scanning and quality gates in automated pipelines
- Understand the separation of concerns between CI (build/test) and CD (deploy) systems

---

## ðŸ§° Prerequisites

- **Completion of LAB01-LAB07:** Strong foundation in ArgoCD operations and multi-environment GitOps workflows
- **Minikube and Argo CD Running:** As per the `ArgoCD/install-and-setup.md` guide
- **`kubectl` Configured:** Pointing to your Minikube cluster with sufficient resources
- **Git and GitHub Account:** For CI/CD pipeline integration and container registry access
- **GitHub Repository:** Either reuse from previous labs or create new repository for this lab
- **Docker Hub Account:** For container image storage (free account works fine)
- **Basic CI/CD Knowledge:** Understanding of build pipelines, testing, and deployment concepts

## ðŸ§¹ Cleanup

Detailed cleanup instructions are provided at the end of **[./LAB.md](./LAB.md)**.

In summary:
1. Delete CI/CD applications from the Argo CD UI
2. Disable or delete GitHub Actions workflows
3. Delete the staging and production namespaces using kubectl
4. Optionally clean up Docker images and GitHub repository changes
5. Optionally stop Minikube
