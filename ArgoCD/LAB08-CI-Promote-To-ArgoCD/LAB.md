# Lab Instructions for LAB08: CI/CD Integration with GitOps Promotion Workflows

This document provides detailed step-by-step instructions for building complete CI/CD pipelines that integrate with GitOps workflows. You'll learn how to automate application builds, testing, image creation, and promotion through environments using GitHub Actions and ArgoCD.

We will start by creating a repository structure and copying the sample application, then build CI/CD pipelines that automatically promote changes through staging to production.

## ðŸš€ Lab Steps

### Phase 1: Copy Lab Materials and Create Repository Structure

**1. Prepare Your GitHub Repository:**
   a. Create a new public GitHub repository named `cicd-gitops-demo` (or reuse existing repository from previous labs)
   b. Clone the repository locally:
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cicd-gitops-demo.git
      cd cicd-gitops-demo
      ```
   c. Create the complete directory structure:
      ```bash
      mkdir -p app/tests
      mkdir -p .github/workflows
      mkdir -p gitops-repo/{environments/{staging,production},argocd-apps}
      mkdir -p scripts
      ```

**2. Copy Sample Python Flask Application:**
   a. Copy the main application files from the lab materials:
      ```bash
      # Copy the Flask application
      cp ../path-to-cicd-labs/ArgoCD/LAB08-CI-Promote-To-ArgoCD/app/main.py ./app/main.py
      
      # Copy application dependencies
      cp ../path-to-cicd-labs/ArgoCD/LAB08-CI-Promote-To-ArgoCD/app/requirements.txt ./app/requirements.txt
      
      # Copy Dockerfile
      cp ../path-to-cicd-labs/ArgoCD/LAB08-CI-Promote-To-ArgoCD/app/Dockerfile ./app/Dockerfile
      ```
   b. Examine the Flask application structure:
      ```bash
      # Review the main application
      cat app/main.py
      
      # Check the dependencies
      cat app/requirements.txt
      
      # Review the Dockerfile
      cat app/Dockerfile
      ```
   c. Notice the application provides multiple endpoints: `/`, `/health`, and `/version`

**3. Copy Unit Tests:**
   a. Copy the test files from the lab materials:
      ```bash
      # Copy test dependencies
      cp ../path-to-cicd-labs/ArgoCD/LAB08-CI-Promote-To-ArgoCD/app/tests/test_requirements.txt ./app/tests/test_requirements.txt
      
      # Copy unit tests
      cp ../path-to-cicd-labs/ArgoCD/LAB08-CI-Promote-To-ArgoCD/app/tests/test_app.py ./app/tests/test_app.py
      ```
   b. Review the test structure:
      ```bash
      # Check test dependencies
      cat app/tests/test_requirements.txt
      
      # Review the unit tests
      cat app/tests/test_app.py
      ```
   c. The tests cover all endpoints and environment variable handling

### Phase 2: Copy GitOps Repository Structure

      cd app
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      python main.py &
      sleep 2
      curl http://localhost:5000/

      cd app
      pip install -r tests/test_requirements.txt
      python -m pytest tests/ -v
      cd ..
      ```

### Phase 6: Set Up GitHub Secrets and Deploy

**20. Commit Initial Code:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial CI/CD GitOps demo setup"
   git push origin main
   ```

**21. Set Up GitHub Secrets:**
   a. Go to your GitHub repository settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions
   b. Add the following repository secrets:
      - `DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username
      - `DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN`: Your Docker Hub access token
   c. To create a Docker Hub access token:
      - Go to Docker Hub â†’ Account Settings â†’ Security
      - Click "New Access Token"
      - Give it a descriptive name like "GitHub Actions"
      - Copy the token and add it as `DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN` secret

**22. Deploy ArgoCD Applications:**
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f gitops-repo/argocd-apps/staging-app.yaml
   kubectl apply -f gitops-repo/argocd-apps/production-app.yaml
   ```

**23. Verify ArgoCD Applications:**
   a. Open ArgoCD UI
   b. You should see two applications: `cicd-demo-staging` and `cicd-demo-production`
   c. The staging application should auto-sync
   d. The production application should be manual sync

### Phase 7: Test Complete CI/CD Pipeline

**24. Trigger Initial CI/CD Pipeline:**
   a. Make a small change to the application:
      ```bash
      sed -i 's/Hello from CI\/CD GitOps Demo!/Hello from Automated CI\/CD Pipeline!/' app/main.py
      git add app/main.py
      git commit -m "Update welcome message"
      git push origin main
      ```
   b. This will trigger the CI build workflow
   c. Watch the workflow in GitHub Actions tab

**25. Monitor Staging Deployment:**
   a. After CI completes, the staging promotion workflow should run
   b. Check ArgoCD UI for staging application sync
   c. Test the staging application:
      ```bash
      minikube ip  # Get Minikube IP
      curl http://<MINIKUBE_IP>:30100/
      ```

**26. Promote to Production:**
   a. In GitHub, go to Actions tab
   b. Run the "Promote to Production" workflow manually
   c. Enter the version tag from staging (check staging kustomization.yaml)
   d. Type "promote" to confirm
   e. Run the workflow

**27. Manually Sync Production:**
   a. In ArgoCD UI, the production application should show "OutOfSync"
   b. Review the changes
   c. Manually click "SYNC" to deploy to production
   d. Test the production application:
      ```bash
      curl http://<MINIKUBE_IP>:30200/
      ```

### Phase 8: Advanced Testing and Validation

**28. Test Rollback Scenario:**
   a. Make a breaking change to the application:
      ```bash
      echo "import invalid_module" >> app/main.py
      git add app/main.py
      git commit -m "Introduce breaking change"
      git push origin main
      ```
   b. The CI pipeline should fail at the test stage
   c. Verify that staging is not updated with the broken version

**29. Test Manual Promotion Override:**
   a. Fix the breaking change:
      ```bash
      git revert HEAD
      git push origin main
      ```
   b. Wait for CI to complete and staging to be updated
   c. Use the promotion script locally:
      ```bash
      ./scripts/promote-environment.sh
      ```
   d. Commit and push the changes

**30. Monitor and Validate Complete Pipeline:**
   a. Check application versions across environments:
      ```bash
      echo "=== Staging Version ==="
      curl http://<MINIKUBE_IP>:30100/version
      echo ""
      echo "=== Production Version ==="
      curl http://<MINIKUBE_IP>:30200/version
      ```
   b. Verify Docker Hub contains the built images
   c. Confirm ArgoCD shows correct sync status for both applications
