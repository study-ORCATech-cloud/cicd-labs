# LAB10: ArgoCD Security - RBAC and Single Sign-On Integration

Welcome to Lab 10! You've mastered comprehensive ArgoCD notifications and monitoring. Now it's time to **secure your ArgoCD instance** with role-based access control (RBAC) and single sign-on (SSO) integration to ensure your GitOps workflows are both powerful and secure.

In production environments, security is paramount. This lab will teach you how to implement enterprise-grade security for ArgoCD, including multi-provider SSO, granular RBAC policies, project-level security, and compliance-ready access controls.

For detailed step-by-step instructions to complete this lab, please refer to **[./LAB.md](./LAB.md)**.

## ✅ Validation Checklist

Refer to the validation checklist at the end of **[./LAB.md](./LAB.md)** after completing the lab steps.

---

## 🧹 Cleanup

Detailed cleanup instructions are provided at the end of **[./LAB.md](./LAB.md)**.

In summary:
1. Remove SSO configurations and revert to admin user access
