# Solutions for LAB03: Efficient Local Development with Docker Compose

This document provides the completed `docker-compose.yml` for LAB03, focusing on setting up an efficient local development environment with live reloading and development-specific configurations.

## âœ… Completed `docker-compose.yml` for Development

Here is the `docker-compose.yml` configured for local development:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  web:
    build: ./app
    ports:
      - "5003:5000" # Host port 5003 mapped to container port 5000
    
    # Solution for TODO_VOLUMES_DEV:
    # Mounts the local ./app directory to /usr/src/app in the container.
    # This allows changes in your local code to be reflected live in the container.
    volumes:
      - ./app:/usr/src/app
    
    # Solution for TODO_ENVIRONMENT_DEV:
    # Sets environment variables for development.
    # - REDIS_HOST tells the Flask app where to find the Redis service.
    # - FLASK_ENV=development enables Flask's debug mode and auto-reloader.
    #   Alternatively, FLASK_DEBUG=1 could be used.
    environment:
      - REDIS_HOST=redis
      - FLASK_ENV=development # Or FLASK_DEBUG=1
      # - FLASK_DEBUG=1 # If you prefer this over FLASK_ENV

    depends_on:
      - redis

  redis:
    image: "redis:6-alpine"
    ports:
      - "6381:6379" # Optional: Exposing Redis on host port 6381
    # volumes:
    #   - redis_lab03_data:/data # Example for persistent Redis data, not required for this lab

# Optional: Define a named volume if you uncommented it for Redis persistence
# volumes:
#   redis_lab03_data:
```

**Key Changes and Why They Matter for Development:**

-   **`volumes: - ./app:/usr/src/app`**:
    *   This is the core of the live-reloading setup. Your local `app` folder (containing `main.py`, `requirements.txt`, etc.) is directly mapped into the `/usr/src/app` folder inside the `web` container (which is its `WORKDIR`).
    *   When you modify a file in your local `./app` directory, that change is instantly seen by the application running inside the container.

-   **`environment: - FLASK_ENV=development`** (or `FLASK_DEBUG=1`):
    *   This environment variable tells Flask to run in development mode.
    *   **Debugger**: If an error occurs, Flask will show a detailed interactive debugger in your browser.
    *   **Auto-Reloader**: Flask's development server will watch for changes in your Python files (via the volume mount) and automatically reload the server, so you don't have to stop/start `docker-compose` for every code change.

-   **`ports: - "5003:5000"`**:
    *   Maps port `5003` on your host machine to port `5000` inside the `web` container. This allows you to access your Flask app by going to `http://localhost:5003` in your browser. The port `5003` is chosen to avoid potential conflicts with Lab02 if it were running on the default `5000` or `5002`.

-   **`depends_on: - redis`**:
    *   Ensures that the `redis` service is started before the `web` service attempts to start, which is good practice as the web app tries to connect to Redis on startup.

With these configurations, you can run `docker-compose up`, edit your Python code in `app/main.py` locally, save the file, and see the changes reflected in your browser almost instantly after the Flask development server reloads.

This setup significantly speeds up the development feedback loop when working with containerized applications.
