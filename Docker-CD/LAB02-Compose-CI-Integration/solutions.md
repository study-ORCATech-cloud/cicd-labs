# Solutions for LAB02: Managing Multi-Container Applications with Docker Compose

This document provides the completed `docker-compose.yml` for LAB02. Students should refer to this after attempting to complete the `TODO`s themselves.

## âœ… Completed `docker-compose.yml`

Here is the complete and working `docker-compose.yml` for defining the Flask web application and Redis service:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  # Solution for TODO_WEB_SERVICE:
  web:
    build: ./app  # Specifies that Dockerfile is in the ./app directory
    ports:
      - "5002:5000" # Maps host port 5002 to container port 5000
    environment:
      - REDIS_HOST=redis # Tells the Flask app that Redis is reachable at hostname 'redis'
      # - FLASK_ENV=development # Optional: for development mode features like debugger
    depends_on:
      - redis # Ensures Redis starts before the web app attempts to connect
    # volumes: # Optional: For live reloading during local development (covered in Lab03)
    #   - ./app:/usr/src/app

  # Solution for TODO_REDIS_SERVICE:
  redis:
    image: "redis:6-alpine" # Uses a lightweight official Redis image
    ports:
      - "6380:6379" # Optional: Exposes Redis on host port 6380 for direct access if needed
    # volumes: # Optional: For Redis data persistence (not strictly needed for this lab's hit counter)
    #   - redis_data:/data

# Optional: Define a named volume if you uncommented it for Redis persistence
# volumes:
#   redis_data:
```

**Key Points for `docker-compose.yml`:**
-   The `web` service builds from the `./app` directory, where its `Dockerfile` is located.
-   `REDIS_HOST=redis` is crucial: Docker Compose creates a network where services can reach each other by their service name. So, the `web` container can find Redis at the hostname `redis`.
-   `depends_on` helps with startup order but doesn't guarantee the dependent service is fully initialized and ready to accept connections (more advanced health checks can handle this, covered in later labs).

By implementing this `docker-compose.yml` file, students learn how to manage a multi-service application locally with Docker Compose, including building images, running services, and enabling inter-service communication.
