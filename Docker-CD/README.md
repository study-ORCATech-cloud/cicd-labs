# Docker-Based CD Labs

Welcome to the **Docker-CD** section of the **CI/CD Automation Labs**. These labs are focused on container-based deployments using Docker, Docker Compose, and integrations with CI/CD tools.

Here, you’ll learn how to build Docker images, run local dev environments, and automate deployments using Compose and CI pipelines.

- Build and test Docker images in CI workflows
- Use Docker Compose for local and CI-based orchestration
- Manage volumes, secrets, health checks, and logs
- Deploy multi-service apps using GitHub Actions
- Push to remote container services like ECS
