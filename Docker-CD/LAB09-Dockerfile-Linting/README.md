# LAB09: Linting Dockerfiles with Hadolint

Well-crafted Dockerfiles are crucial for creating efficient, secure, and maintainable container images. Dockerfile linters help you adhere to best practices, catch common errors, and optimize your image builds. In this lab, you'll learn to use **Hadolint**, a popular Dockerfile linter, to analyze and improve a sample Dockerfile.

This lab focuses on using Hadolint locally via its Docker image, aligning with the Docker-CD track's emphasis on leveraging Docker tools for development and CI/CD tasks.

---

## üéØ Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will:
- Understand the importance of Dockerfile linting.
- Use Hadolint (via its Docker image) to lint a `Dockerfile`.
- Interpret Hadolint's feedback (error codes and suggestions).
- Correct common Dockerfile issues based on linter recommendations.
- Appreciate how linting contributes to better Docker image quality.

---

## üß∞ Prerequisites

-   **Docker Installed:** You'll need Docker to run Hadolint from its official image.

## üìÇ Folder Structure for This Lab

```bash
Docker-CD/LAB09-Dockerfile-Linting/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile-to-lint    # The sample Dockerfile with intentional issues for you to lint
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py               # Placeholder Python file (not used by the app, for Dockerfile context only)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt      # Placeholder requirements file (for Dockerfile context only)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md             # Lab instructions (this file)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ solutions.md          # Shows linter output and the corrected Dockerfile
```
**Note:** `main.py` and `requirements.txt` are minimal placeholders. The focus of this lab is on linting the `Dockerfile-to-lint`, not on building or running a Python application.

## üöÄ Lab Steps

**1. Review the `Dockerfile-to-lint`:**
   Open and examine the `Dockerfile-to-lint` file. It's designed for a generic Python application and intentionally contains several common mistakes and areas for improvement that a linter can help identify.

**2. Run Hadolint via Docker:**
   To lint the `Dockerfile-to-lint` without installing Hadolint locally, you can use its official Docker image. Navigate to this lab's directory (`Docker-CD/LAB09-Dockerfile-Linting/`) in your terminal and run the following command:

   ```bash
   docker run --rm -i -v "$(pwd)/Dockerfile-to-lint:/Dockerfile" hadolint/hadolint hadolint /Dockerfile
   ```
   Let's break down this command:
   *   `docker run --rm -i`: Runs a Docker container and removes it once it exits (`--rm`). `-i` is for interactive mode, often needed when piping or providing input, though here we primarily use volume mounting.
   *   `-v "$(pwd)/Dockerfile-to-lint:/Dockerfile"`: This mounts your local `Dockerfile-to-lint` into the Hadolint container at the path `/Dockerfile`.
        *   **Windows PowerShell Users:** `$(pwd)` might not work as expected. Replace it with the absolute path to the file or use `${PWD}` if in Git Bash or a similar shell. Example: `-v "D:/path/to/your/cicd-labs/Docker-CD/LAB09-Dockerfile-Linting/Dockerfile-to-lint:/Dockerfile"`
        *   **Windows CMD Users:** Replace `"$(pwd)/Dockerfile-to-lint:/Dockerfile"` with `"%cd%\Dockerfile-to-lint:/Dockerfile"`.
   *   `hadolint/hadolint`: The official Hadolint Docker image.
   *   `hadolint /Dockerfile`: The command executed inside the container, telling Hadolint to lint the file at `/Dockerfile` (which is your mounted local file).

**3. Analyze Hadolint's Output:**
   Hadolint will output a list of warnings and errors, each with:
   *   The line number in your Dockerfile.
   *   A rule code (e.g., `DL3006`, `SC2035`).
   *   A description of the issue and often a suggestion for fixing it.
   Take some time to understand each piece of feedback.

**4. Create `Dockerfile-fixed.solution`:**
   Based on Hadolint's output and your understanding of Dockerfile best practices:
   *   Create a **new file** named `Dockerfile-fixed.solution` in this lab directory.
   *   Copy the content from `Dockerfile-to-lint` into `Dockerfile-fixed.solution`.
   *   Modify `Dockerfile-fixed.solution` to address the issues identified by Hadolint.
   Your goal is to make the Dockerfile more efficient, secure, and maintainable.

**5. Validate Your Fixes:**
   Run Hadolint again, this time pointing to your `Dockerfile-fixed.solution`:

   ```bash
   # Adjust the path to your fixed file
   docker run --rm -i -v "$(pwd)/Dockerfile-fixed.solution:/Dockerfile" hadolint/hadolint hadolint /Dockerfile
   ```
   Ideally, you should see no errors or significantly fewer warnings. Some stylistic warnings might remain or require configuration (which is beyond this lab's basic scope).

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

- [ ] Successfully ran Hadolint against `Dockerfile-to-lint` using the Docker command.
- [ ] Understood the different types of warnings/errors reported by Hadolint.
- [ ] Created `Dockerfile-fixed.solution` with corrections applied.
- [ ] Ran Hadolint against `Dockerfile-fixed.solution` and observed a reduction or elimination of issues.
- [ ] Can explain the reasoning behind the major fixes applied.

---

## üßπ Cleanup

- No specific cleanup is needed for this lab, as Hadolint runs on demand via a temporary Docker container (`--rm` ensures it's removed).
- You will have the `Dockerfile-to-lint` and your `Dockerfile-fixed.solution` files.

## üß† Key Concepts Review

-   **Dockerfile Linting**: The process of automatically checking Dockerfiles for errors, bad practices, and style issues.
-   **Hadolint**: A popular, widely-used Dockerfile linter that incorporates rules from ShellCheck (for `RUN` instructions) and its own Dockerfile-specific rules.
-   **Linter Rules (e.g., DLxxxx, SCxxxx)**: Specific checks performed by the linter. Understanding these helps in writing better Dockerfiles.
-   **Benefits of Linting**: Improved image security, smaller image sizes, faster build times, better maintainability, and consistency.
-   **Running Linters in Docker**: A convenient way to use tools like Hadolint without needing to install them directly on your system.

--- 

## üöÄ Advanced Considerations (Optional)

-   **`.hadolint.yaml`**: Hadolint can be configured using a `.hadolint.yaml` file to ignore specific rules or specify trusted registries.
-   **CI/CD Integration**: Integrating linters into your Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline (e.g., with GitHub Actions, Jenkins) can automate checks on every code change, ensuring Dockerfiles maintain high quality. The original `README.md` for this lab had an example for GitHub Actions.
